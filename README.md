Image Subsampling with OpenCV
This Java program demonstrates image subsampling using the OpenCV library. It reads an input image, gradually subsamples it to a desired size, and displays the subsampled image in a window.

Prerequisites
Before running the program, make sure you have the following:

OpenCV library installed and configured in your Java project.
An input image file (rt.jfif in this example) located at the specified path (D:/rt.jfif). You can replace this path with the path to your own input image file.
